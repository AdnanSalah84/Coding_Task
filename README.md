Note:
Binary search could not be applied in this case because we are not storing result into array, we are performing calculation to find decay. Binary search could be applied only if data is sorted and store either in database or array. 

First to sort all records and save into array while in given solution break technique is used wherever solution found terminate loop.

I hope you understand logic! :)
